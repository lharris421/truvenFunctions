# Functions for working with Truven Databases

This code is a set of functions I put together to work with Truven databases which contain large health care claims datasets. 

I used this to facilitate my work as a GRA at the University of Iowa.

This does not serve as a resource for others to use outside of the main research group as it works with databases that were preprocessed by another memeber of the research group and as such are unlikely to prove useful outside of this context.
